  - "_What may be a hassle at first soon becomes habit, and eventually a source of pride and productivity for all involved._" ~ [cbeams](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#:~:text=What%20may%20be%20a%20hassle%20at%20first%20soon%20becomes%20habit%2C%20and%20eventually%20a%20source%20of%20pride%20and%20productivity%20for%20all%20involved.)

  - "_Persistence and variety. These are the two primary ways to develop great ideas or to solve important problems.<br/><br/>Keep leaning your head against a topic for a long time. Certainly for weeks, possibly for years. And along the way, try many lines of attack. Continue to generate options, explore paths, and propose silly ideas. Copy and paste concepts from widely different disciplines and see if it gets you anywhere. All the while, continue to refine the best solution you've found thus far.<br/><br/>What looks like genius may simply be the byproduct of persistence and variety._" ~ James Clear

  - "_The truth about productivity is that it's not really about the apps, it's not really about having a perfect system or about being disciplined or motivated more than anyone else.<br/><br/>When I think of my own life and how I do things like: YouTube channel, entrepreneurship, medical school, being a doctor, none of it feels like suffering, none of it feels like a grind. So, when my housemate says: "It's 11 o'clock at night, why are you still working?", it's always a bit surprising because it really doesn't feel like work because it's actually fun.<br/><br/>The main insight that I've realized is that productivity isn't really about getting more things done, it's mostly about LEARNING TO ENJOY THE JOURNEY._" ~ [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zbGR03h1uAU)

  - "_If you find that you're spending almost all your time on theory, start turning some attention to practical things; it will improve your theories. If you find that you're spending almost all your time on practice, start turning some attention to theoretical things; it will improve your practice._" ~ Donald Knuth

  - "_One of the most valuable skills in life is being able to see another person's perspective.<br/><br/>If you're going to someone's house, think about how it might feel to be the host. If you're creating a product, spend as much time as possible thinking like the customer. If you're calling customer service, think about how it might feel to be on the other end of the conversation.<br/><br/>The more clearly you understand the viewpoint of your spouse or customer or coworker, the better positioned you are to find a solution._" ~ James Clear

  - "_Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way._" ~ Viktor E. Frankl in [Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning)

- 24/11/2023  
  - "_You probably don't want maximum effectiveness.<br/><br/>For example, the most effective way to make money likely requires a lifestyle you don't want to live. Instead, you want the most effective path that fits your desired lifestyle.<br/><br/>How do you want to spend your days? Start there, then optimize._" ~ James Clear

  - "_Socially, we’re told, “Go work out. Go look good.” That’s a multi-player competitive game. Other people can see if I’m doing a good job or not. We’re told, “Go make money. Go buy a big house.” Again, external multiplayer competitive game. Training yourself to be happy is completely internal. There is no external progress, no external validation. You’re competing against yourself—it is a single-player game._" ~ Eric Jorgenson in [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54898389-the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant)

  - "_I think a lot of people, they do like the company of others, but I think they maybe like the company of others because it takes them off their own mind._" ~ [Bryan Johnson](https://youtu.be/Ci7cWTGLm1Q?si=uN8fwpxEOfNmEZnG&t=970)

  - "_Three qualities that have nothing to do with talent or intelligence, but can make a dramatic impact on your results: Cheerful - You are pleasant to work with and generally raise the level of energy in the room. Accountable - You feel personally responsible for what you want to accomplish. It is not someone else's job. It's your job. Adaptable - You can find alternate paths to success. You don't need things to be a certain way to be happy._" ~ James Clear

  - "_Running one mile has more in common with running a marathon than sitting at home.<br/><br/>Investing $100 has more in common with being a millionaire than being broke.<br/><br/>Writing one sentence has more in common with writing a book than never writing one.<br/><br/>It always feels small in the beginning and the big goals seem far away. It's easy to talk yourself out of the early attempts because they feel kind of meaningless.<br/><br/>But every race starts with one step. Every fortune starts with a small deposit. Every book begins as one sentence.<br/><br/>The real question is not "What is my current position?" but rather, "What is my current trajectory?" Doing nothing builds nothing. Put yourself on the path to something better. Start small, but make sure you start._" ~ James Clear

  - "_I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel._" ~ Maya Angelou
