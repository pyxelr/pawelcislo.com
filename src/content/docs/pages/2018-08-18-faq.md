Well, maybe I'm not as popular to be frequently asked about all these things; however, you can treat this page more like an aggregator for some of my handy answers.  
  
If you have a question that was not listed on this page, please do not hesitate to [get in touch with me](https://pawelcislo.com/contact/). I will also try to let myself be known in different posts and pages of this blog.

* * *

1. **Why did you start this** **blog?**  
    I tried to answer this question in depth in [my first post](https://pawelcislo.com/2018/09/07/foreword-of-the-greater-intention/).  
    Briefly speaking, I enjoy writing, and I would feel unfulfilled keeping all the exciting stuff locked in my mind without sharing it with someone who might greatly benefit from it.  
      
    
2. **What is your life goal/direction?**  
    To be happy with what I do for the living and contribute as much as I can to the constantly developing world, leaving the universe in a better state in the end.  
      
    
3. **Your** **motto?**  
    _"**Try to be the best version of yourself**".  
      
    _I also keep _"**Done is better than**_ _**perfect**"_ close to my heart, to ease my fight with procrastination and perfectionism.  
    You can find the list of all my favourite thoughts [here](https://pawelcislo.com/favourite-thoughts/) (updated regularly).  
      
    
4. **Answer in one word: _What is the must-have for success_?**

7. **Let's get a bit more technical. What do you prefer: Python, R or maybe something else?**  
    I always say that in data science it's the most important to excel in logic and statistical familiarity. Later, the language is like a suit you wear, and in my case, I mostly reach for Python. I found many senior R developers, who claimed that they would start with Python if they got another chance (mainly for the reason of ML-based resources); however, I'm jealous of their pretty looking RStudio.  
      
    Once I found a great comparison between the languages in a [single presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/VineetJaiswal8/r-and-python-a-code-demo), which might give you a clear contrast between both options.  
      
    You may also want to try and combine both languages to use the best part of each. [This blog post](https://www.business-science.io/business/2018/10/08/python-and-r.html) should explain how to do it most conveniently.  
    tl;dr:  
    ‚Ä¢ (R) reticulate for connecting R with Python  
    ‚Ä¢ (R)¬†tidyverse for data exploration  
    ‚Ä¢ (Python) scikit-learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML and DL  
    ‚Ä¢ (R) ggplot2 for visualisation  
    ‚Ä¢ (R) R Markdown for reporting and Shiny for web apps  
      
    Apart from these technologies, we need to keep our heads up for the rapid intake of Julia and Scala, which seem to be more optimised over Python.  
      
    
8. **IDE for data science?**  
    ‚Ä¢ [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (explained thoroughly in "[My VS Code Playground](https://pawelcislo.com/2021/11/14/my-vs-code-playground/)" blog post)  
    ‚Ä¢ [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) specifically for R  
    ‚Ä¢ [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for the web IDE  
      
    
9. **Can you also recommend me XYZ (blogs, tools, data science resources, programming learning materials, etc.)?**  
    Sure, have a look at [my great list of recommendations](https://pawelcislo.com/recommendations/).  
      
    
10. **What books are you currently reading? Do you publish some reviews?**  
    Of course, you can check my reading progress and the [reviews on my¬†Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/57442889-pawel-cislo?order=d&shelf=read&sort=review&view=reviews). I am also spending a lot of time with online materials and annotating them with [my Hypothes.is account](https://hypothes.is/users/pyxelr).  
      
    
11. **Favourite entertainment website?**  
    [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) for music and [X](https://x.com/)/[Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for online discussions. Talking about SoundCloud, I realised it is not only my main entertainment website since 2012 but a permanent source of joy through everyday fresh tunes [that I like](https://soundcloud.com/pyxelr/likes). Thanks to this orange cloud, I could find many artists, friends and sources of influence, such as [Aika](https://soundcloud.com/i-am-aika), [CruciA](https://soundcloud.com/crucia), [synx](https://soundcloud.com/synxelectronic) and [Souhex](https://soundcloud.com/souhex), who play a huge part in my life.  
      
    In my free time, I want to be more active on the site and start sharing more of my own creations.  
      
    
12. **Favourite TV show?**  
    I don't usually watch any TV series, but [Mr. Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/) gave me a lot of a great time of reflection.  
      
    
13. **I want to be like you or XYZ?**  
    Don't waste your time trying to be like anyone else.¬† Moreover, do not compare yourself to others as you can only harm yourself this way. Let yourself have some influencers, but do not copy them. Everyone is beautiful in their being, and this is why the world can advance, by brainstorming through unique views and forming exceptional solutions.  
      
    
14. **I love your content a ton! Can I support you anywhere?**  
    You already mean a lot to me by sticking around to my online persona! However, if you're such a determined and lovely person, you can¬†[drop me a donation on my PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/pawelcislo/3.14).
