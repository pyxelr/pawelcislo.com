title: "Three Goals"

## Preface

**Three Goals** is one of the most critical productivity methods. In short, the idea consists of breaking our goals/dreams into smaller stages that are easier to achieve. After completing each level, we reward ourselves with a previously specified award.

I am constantly learning and exploring myself; therefore, some entries are still in the experimental phase. It means that part of the goals might be respecified or even dropped, but the most essential is their motivational aspect (strengthen by publishing them on this site).

## Rules

All of the desirable achievements are divided into three levels:

- Easy (≈ 10%)
- Medium (≈ 30%)
- Hard (100%)

After each level, I treat myself with an award:

- Level 1: dinner at the restaurant
- Level 2: good-looking clothes
- Level 3: weekend trip

Besides, objectives are supported by:

- inspirations to encourage us in the moments of self-doubt
- deadlines, because otherwise, our plans would stay solely as dreams.

## Source of influence

The following list is designed entirely by taking the inspiration from **[MiroBurn](https://miroburn.pl/cele)**, whom I am following for a longer time. MiroBurn (Mirek Burnejko) is a polish entrepreneur and master of life hacking in my eyes, where one of his core principles is having long-term goals.
