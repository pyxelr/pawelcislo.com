title: "Recommendations for Engineers"
date: 2019-11-24
---

All of my recommendations for aspiring engineers in a single place, coming from various areas of interest. The principal scope supports data science, programming, python, math, cybersecurity, business, and productivity.

The list also aggregates and extends most of the suggestions from my blog posts, where some of the entries come from a different language (🇵🇱). Although it's my personal list, don't hesitate to [tell me](https://pawelcislo.com/contact/) if I missed something interesting or if there is a dead link. You are also welcome to create a pull request and see the history of edits in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pyxelr/recommendations-for-engineers).

_Tip_: The catalogue is sorted chronologically, but I believe it is easier and more practical to browse this site by categories (using the TOC).
